## Welcome to My Website

This website is created as a reflection on my experience throughout my career in the technology field. This site will never contain information that reflects the views of my employers (past or present). These views are strictly my own. Feel free to use information here for your benefit. I aim to provide information I have accumulated over the years in order to help people who come behind me. I am a firm believer in not doing more work than necessary and working smarter, not harder. Finding content online has been crucial to my education and professional success. I hope that some of this content will afford the same to others.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/phaughney22/chickenscratch/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

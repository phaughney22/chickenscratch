## Welcome to My Website

This website is created as a reflection on my experience throughout my career in the technology field. This site will never contain information that reflects the views of my employers (past or present). These views are strictly my own. Feel free to use information here for your benefit. I aim to provide information I have accumulated over the years in order to help people who come behind me. I am a firm believer in not doing more work than necessary and working smarter, not harder. Finding content online has been crucial to my education and professional success. That being said, most of these ideas and many of the scripts or code are not necessarily written by me. I will try to include sources when I have them. Like most tech professionals I simply Google a few things better than the average user. Hopefully compiling some of this information in a central location will prove helpful for anyone who needs it.
